	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Crops segments, given by a labeling, of an image. The pixels
			that are
			not defined by the according segment a filled either with
			the maximum,
			minimum pixel value or zero.

			Two cases:
			<ul>
				<li>No additional Image: BitMasks of the ROIs will be
					extracted.
				</li>
				<li>
					Additional Image: ROI will be filled with the values of the
					provided image.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</intro>
		<tab name="Options">

			<option name="Labeling Column">Labeling representing the Region of Interests
				(ROIs) to be cropped.
			</option>

			<option name="Image Column (optional)">How the image pixel will be organised in the
				memory. May have impact on the runtime of algorithms.
			</option>
			<option name="Background">
				As we crop an labeling into a rectangular
				bounding box image, some
				pixels may not be covered by the ROI. Select the value of these
				pixels.
				<ul>
					<li>Minimum value of result image</li>
					<li>Maximum value of result image</li>
					<li>Set value to zero</li>
				</ul>

		<tab name="Segment Label Filter">
			<option name="Filter on segment labels">
				Only labels which hold
				the given rule considered
				during the calculation.
			</option>
			<option name="Append labels of overlapping segments">
				If true, the labels of overlapping segments will
				be appended in an additional column (';'-separated).
			</option>
			<option name="Overlapping segments do NOT need to completely overlap">
				If selected, segments will also be counted as
				overlapping, if so don't
				overlap completely.
			</option>

			<option name="Filter on overlapping segment labels">
				Only the labels that comply with the specified
				rules will appear in the list of overlapping labels.
